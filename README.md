# Auburn University Hey Day
Hey Day is more than a half century old Auburn tradition which was started after the **World War II** as a way to appreciate the veterans on returning back to school. The **Student Government Association** celebrates **October 14** as the Hey Day every year. Over past 73 years, this has transformed into a way to promote a friendly environment on campus. Students greet their peers with a **"Hey!"** on this day.
